# 🚗 Car Insurance Claim Prediction (Machine Learning Project)

This project predicts whether a customer is likely to file a **car insurance claim**, using machine learning classification techniques. The model helps insurance companies identify high-risk customers and make data-driven decisions regarding pricing, risk assessment, and fraud detection.

## 📌 Project Overview
Insurance companies face challenges in predicting which customers may file claims in the near future. This project builds a machine learning pipeline that:

- Cleans and preprocesses customer data  
- Performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Trains multiple ML models  
- Selects the best-performing classifier  
- Predicts claim probability for new customers

## 🧠 Features of the Project
### ✔ Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values  
- Feature encoding (Label/One-Hot Encoding)  
- Feature scaling  
- Removing noise & outliers  

### ✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution analysis  
- Correlation heatmap  
- Risk factor visualization  
- Claim vs Non-claim pattern study  

### ✔ Model Building
Models used:
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- XGBoost / Gradient Boosting  
- KNN / SVM (optional)  

The best model is selected based on:
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-Score  
- ROC-AUC  

### ✔ Final Output
- Predicts whether a customer will file a claim  
- Shows probability score  
- Ready for API/Flask integration
